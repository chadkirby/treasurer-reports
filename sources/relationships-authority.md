Authority flows from state law through the governing documents to the HOA.

- State Law grants corporate powers to govern, manage finances, and enforce rules.
- The HOA's Declaration grants authority to enforce use restrictions, collect assessments, and maintain common areas.
- VIS Group's contract obliges them to follow the HOA's Declaration and Bylaws.
