# Methodology and Disclaimers

## Data Sources
The financial data presented in this report was derived from General Ledger (GL) Report spreadsheets provided by the Management Company, covering the period from June 2020 through January 2026.

Unlike standard "Profit & Loss" statements, which summarize data into broad categories, the GL Report allows for the analysis of every individual check, deposit, and invoice.

## Methodology: Cash-Flow vs. Accounting Categories
Standard financial reports often obscure where cash actually goes due to accounting conventions. To create the charts in this presentation, NotebookLM performed the heavy lifting of data analysis using a "cash-flow" methodology:

- Reclassifying "Contra-Revenue": The Management Company recorded payments to the Developer (Lotus House) as negative income (debits to GL 300150) rather than expenses. In standard reports, these vanish from the expense column. NotebookLM has reclassified these as Cash Outflows to transparently show that money left the Association’s bank account.

- Vendor Grouping: NotebookLM grouped payments by Payee/Vendor Name rather than the account code used. For example, payments to Simply Home Realty were found in both "Landscaping" and "Maintenance" accounts.

- 2020 Data: The 2020 data covers only June through December. Annualized comparisons for that year should be viewed with caution.

## Conclusion

These figures should be viewed as **directionally accurate rather than forensic absolutes**.

However, the macro trends (specifically regarding the escalation of stormwater costs, the total volume of payments to the Developer, and the aggregate cost of management services) are well supported by the record.
