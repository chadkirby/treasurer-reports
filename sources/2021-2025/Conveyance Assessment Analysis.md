# Potential Misuse of Conveyance Assessment Funds

## Background

The Deschutes Heights Homeowners' Association is a nonprofit corporation incorporated in 2011. It is legally bound by its Declaration (as amended), a recorded document that functions as the supreme 'constitution' for the HOA. The Declaration not only grants the Board the power to enforce rules and collect assessments, but it also strictly constrains the Board’s actions. The Board cannot legally take any action, pass any rule, or enforce any agreement that conflicts with the Declaration.

## What the governing documents require:

- At closing, the Amended Declaration requires each property purchaser to pay a $500 Conveyance Assessment "to the Association"
- The Amended Declaration requires that Conveyance Assessments "shall be used exclusively to fund maintenance, repair and/or replacement of the Common Areas"

## What actually happened:

- $52.5 in Conveyance Assessments have been collected by the HOA
- Between 2021-25, $52.5k of Conveyance Assessment funds were paid to the Developer (Lotus House Development Corp)

    - 2021: $15,500 ($3,500 Check #16 Invoice #20210310 + $12k Check #17 Invoice #20210310)
    - 2022: $14,500 (Check #37 Invoice #20220125-1)
    - 2023: $10,500 (Check #55 Invoice #20230303)
    - 2024: $4,500 (Check #70 Invoice #20240308)
    - 2025: $7,500 (Check #92 Invoice #20250919)


## The Developer's justification:

- In October 2019, the Developer submitted a retrospective claim for "startup costs" and "loans" dating back to 2012 and totalling just over $34k (see below)
As documentation for the claim, the Developer submitted 25 pages of legal bills, handwritten notes, and summarized Quickbooks transactions

## The problems:

Even if we take the Developer's documentation at face value, the HOA has overpaid by over $18k.

More fundamentally, Conveyance Assessment funds were clearly used to reimburse the Developer for costs (e.g. legal fees, startup costs, etc.) that have nothing to do with common area maintenance. However, the governing documents prohibit the use of Conveyance Assessments for such costs.

## Why this likely happened (management company accounting choices)

- The claimed "loan" was never booked as a liability, so repayments did not reduce a tracked balance.
- Payments were booked to a revenue account that routinely netted to zero, which obscured both inflows and outflows on summary reports.
- The lack of a tracked balance meant there was no clear point at which the supposed loan had been repaid.
- This accounting approach likely contributed to the HOA paying at least $18k more than the Developer’s own stated claim.
