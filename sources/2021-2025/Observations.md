1. Reserve Funding vs. Developer Payments

Over the five-year period from 2021–2025, the Association transferred $46,728 to its Reserve account for future capital improvements and repairs. During the same period, the Association paid $52,500 to Lotus House (the Developer).

The Association prioritized payments to the Developer over funding its own reserves by approximately $5,772.

2. Management Company Costs

VIS Group and Simply Home received $86,300 over six years, representing the single largest category of HOA spending. This exceeds spending on landscaping ($76,200), water utilities ($32,400), and all other operational expenses.

Management fees represent approximately 24% of total HOA expenditures during this period.

3. Conveyance Assessment Payments

See Conveyance Assessment Analysis.md for details.

4. Sustainable Groundworks Spending

Payments to Sustainable Groundworks showed significant volatility: $8,650 (2022), $5,150 (2023), $10,311 (2024), and $9,039 (2025).

These services are for stormwater maintenance. We have an agreement with the county to maintain the stormwater facilities. See Stormwater Maintenance.md for details.

5. Overall Financial Position

Total inflows remained relatively stable from 2021–2025 (averaging approximately $75,000 annually). Total outflows during this same period averaged approximately $65,000 annually, suggesting the Association has maintained positive cash flow.

However, the adequacy of reserve funding relative to anticipated future capital needs has not been established through a reserve study.
