### Comparison with Cash Outflows by Payee:
1. Simply Home Impact: By moving Simply Home Realty expenses ($6.7k total) from "VIS Group" to **Landscaping & Maintenance**, you can see that maintaining the common areas actually costs about **$85k** over 5 years, not the $76k paid to the main landscaper.
2. Developer vs. Reserves: The chart starkly illustrates that in 2021 and 2022, the HOA paid more than double to the Developer (30k)than it saved for its own future repairs (10k).
3. Stormwater Trend: The Stormwater category (row 5) shows the most aggressive growth, going from 0 in 2020/2021 to over 9k in 2025. This confirms the escalating "frequency and cost" issue you identified.
