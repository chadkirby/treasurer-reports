# Why Does the HOA Exist? (And What Do We Have to Pay For?)

## Our Mission
- **Purpose:** Create and maintain a desirable, attractive subdivision for the mutual benefit and protection of all owners. (See 2011 CC&Rs, Preamble.)
- **Authority:** The HOA is the legal entity empowered to enforce rules and collect assessments needed to operate and maintain the community. (See First Amendment to CC&Rs, Article I(S).)

## Obligation #1: Stormwater System
- **Legal requirement:** The Association is bound by a Residential Subdivision Maintenance Agreement (originally Thurston County; now City of Tumwater jurisdiction).
- **Required work:** Inspect, clean, maintain, and repair catch basins, pipes, wet ponds, and infiltration ponds (including Tract C facilities) to prevent water-quality impacts. (See 2014 Addendum to Maintenance Agreement.)
- **Enforcement risk:** If the HOA fails to perform, the City can enter, perform the work, and lien the HOA for costs. (See Maintenance Agreement, Remedies section.)

## Obligation #2: Common Area Maintenance
- **Legal requirement:** Maintain defined common areas, including open space tracts, trails, and recreation areas. (See 2011 CC&Rs, Article I(R); First Amendment, Article I(S)(1).)
- **Practical scope includes:**
  - Tracts B, C, D, F, L, M, and N (open spaces).
  - Tot lots (playgrounds) and the 2.97-acre trail easement.
  - Utilities serving common areas (including street lighting where applicable). (See 2011 CC&Rs, Article I(R); First Amendment, Article I(S)(1)(iv).)

## Obligation #3: Financial Safety
- **Legal requirement:** Carry liability/property insurance and fund reserves for major future replacement/repair obligations. (See First Amendment, Article I(S)(3); Bylaws, Article 6.2.)
- **Why it matters:** Reserve contributions reduce special-assessment risk and help avoid deferring predictable high-cost projects.
