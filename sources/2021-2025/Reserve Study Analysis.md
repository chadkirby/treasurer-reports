# Review of 2024-2025 Reserve Studies against Governing Documents and State Law

1. Overview of Reserve Health
Based on the 2025 Reserve Study (Report #46458-2), the Association’s financial position is currently classified as "Fair" but carries a "Medium" risk of special assessments.
- Percent Funded: 49.4% (up from 43.1% in 2024).
- Cash Balance (Projected 1/1/25): $35,075.
- Fully Funded Balance (Required): $71,015.
- Deficit: ($327) per unit average deficit.
- Recommended Contribution: $950/month (100% funding goal).

Critical Observation: This "Fair" rating is an illusion. It is calculated based on a list of assets that excludes the community's most expensive infrastructure (Stormwater). If the Stormwater system were included as required by your recorded Maintenance Agreement, the "Fully Funded Balance" target would rise significantly, likely dropping the Association's actual status to "Weak" (<30%) and the risk of Special Assessment to "High."

## Risk Flags / Questions
- Stormwater maintenance obligations may not be fully reflected in the reserve study scope.
- Reserve funding contributions appear below target relative to expected long-term obligations.
- Repayments to the Developer may have used funds that were legally obligated to the reserve account.
