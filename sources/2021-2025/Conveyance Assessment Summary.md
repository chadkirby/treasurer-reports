# Improper Use of Conveyance Assessment Funds

## What the governing documents require
- A $500 Conveyance Assessment is paid to the HOA at each home sale (unless the lot was sold by Lotus House Development Corp).
- Funds must be used exclusively for common area maintenance (operational or reserve).

## What the ledgers show (2021-2025)
- $52.5k in Conveyance Assessment funds were paid to the Developer (Lotus House).
- The Developer's documented claim totals roughly $34k for historical startup costs.
- Even using the Developer's own documentation, the HOA appears to have overpaid by over $18k.

## Why this likely happened (management company accounting choices)
- The Developer "loan" was never recorded as a liability, so repayments did not reduce a tracked balance.
- Payments ran through a revenue account (GL 300150) that netted to zero, obscuring cash outflows on summary reports.
- Without a tracked balance, there was no clear point when the "loan" was repaid.
- It's also possible that VIS never really considered this to be a "loan", but rather some kind of informal reimbursement outside the scope of the governing documents.

## Why it matters
- Restricted funds were likely used for non-eligible costs, creating a potential compliance risk.
- Reserve funding capacity was reduced during a period of underfunding.
