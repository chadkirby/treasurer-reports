# Why Does the HOA Exist? (And What Do We Have to Pay For?)

## 1. Our Mission (Per the Declaration)
- **Purpose:** Create and maintain a desirable, attractive subdivision for the mutual benefit and protection of all owners.
  - Source: 2011 CC&Rs, Preamble.
- **Authority:** The HOA is the legal entity empowered to enforce rules and collect assessments needed to operate and maintain the community.
  - Source: First Amendment to CC&Rs, Article I(S).

## 2. Obligation #1: Stormwater System (Primary Liability)
- **Legal requirement:** The Association is bound by a Residential Subdivision Maintenance Agreement (originally Thurston County; now City of Tumwater jurisdiction).
- **Required work:** Inspect, clean, maintain, and repair catch basins, pipes, wet ponds, and infiltration ponds (including Tract C facilities) to prevent water-quality impacts.
  - Source: 2014 Addendum to Maintenance Agreement.
- **Enforcement risk:** If the HOA fails to perform, the City can enter, perform the work, and lien the HOA for costs.

## 3. Obligation #2: Common Area Maintenance (Curb Appeal and Use)
- **Legal requirement:** Maintain defined common areas, including open space tracts, trails, and recreation areas.
  - Source: 2011 CC&Rs, Article I(R); First Amendment, Article I(S)(1).
- **Practical scope includes:**
  - Tracts B, C, D, F, L, M, and N (open spaces).
  - Tot lots (playgrounds) and the 2.97-acre trail easement.
  - Utilities serving common areas (including street lighting where applicable).
  - Source: 2011 CC&Rs, Article I(R); First Amendment, Article I(S)(1)(iv).

## 4. Obligation #3: Financial Safety (Insurance and Reserves)
- **Legal requirement:** Carry liability/property insurance and fund reserves for major future replacement/repair obligations.
  - Source: First Amendment, Article I(S)(3); Bylaws, Article 6.2.
- **Why it matters:** Reserve contributions reduce special-assessment risk and help avoid deferring predictable high-cost projects.
