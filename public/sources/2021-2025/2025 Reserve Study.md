# Welcome to your Reserve Study!

**A** Reserve Study is a valuable tool to help you budget responsibly for your property. This report contains all the information you need to avoid surprise expenses, make informed decisions, save money, and protect property values.

**R** egardless of the property type, it's a fact of life that the very moment construction is completed, every major building component begins a predictable process of physical deterioration. The operative word is "predictable" because planning for the inevitable is what a Reserve Study by Association Reserves is all about!

In this Report, you will find three key results:

- **Component List**  
  Unique to each property, the Component List serves as the foundation of the Reserve Study and details the scope and schedule of all necessary repairs & replacements.

- **Reserve Fund Strength**  
  A calculation that measures how well the Reserve Fund has kept pace with the property's physical deterioration.

- **Reserve Funding Plan**  
  A multi-year funding plan based on current Reserve Fund strength that allows for component repairs and replacements to be completed in a timely manner, with an emphasis on fairness and avoiding "catch-up" funding.

## Economic Assumptions:

- Net Annual "After Tax" Interest Earnings Accruing to Reserves ……………………………… 1.00 %
- Annual Inflation Rate …………………………………………………………………………………… 3.00 %

- This is a Update "No-Site-Visit", meeting all requirements of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW). This study was prepared by, or under the supervision of a credentialed Reserve Specialist (RS™).

- Your Reserve Fund is currently 49.4 % Funded. This means the association’s special assessment & deferred maintenance risk is currently Medium. The objective of your multi-year Funding Plan is to fund your Reserves to a level where you will enjoy a low risk of such Reserve cash flow problems. The current annual deterioration of your reserve components is $5,588 - see Component Significance table.

- Based on this starting point and your anticipated future expenses, our recommendation is to budget Reserve Transfers to within the 70% to 100% range as noted above. The 100% "Full" and 70% transfer rates are designed to gradually achieve these funding objectives by the end of our 30-year report scope.

- No assets appropriate for Reserve designation known to be excluded. See appendix for component information and the basis of our assumptions. "Baseline Funding" in this report is as defined within the RCW, "to maintain the reserve account balance above zero throughout the thirty-year study period, without special assessments." Funding plan transfer rates, and reserves deficit or (surplus) are presented as an aggregate total, assuming average percentage of ownership. The actual ownership allocation may vary - refer to your governing documents, and assessment computational tools to adjust for any variation.

# Introduction

A Reserve Study is the art and science of anticipating, and preparing for, an association's major common area repair and replacement expenses. Partially art, because in this field we are making projections about the future. Partially science, because our work is a combination of research and well-defined computations, following consistent National Reserve Study Standard principles.

The foundation of this and every Reserve Study is your Reserve Component List (what you are reserving for). This is because the Reserve Component List defines the scope and schedule of all your anticipated upcoming Reserve projects. Based on that List and your starting balance, we calculate the association's Reserve Fund Strength (reported in terms of "Percent Funded"). Then we compute a Reserve Funding Plan to provide for the Reserve needs of the association. These form the three results of your Reserve Study.

Reserve funding is not "for the future". Ongoing Reserve transfers are intended to offset the ongoing, daily deterioration of your Reserve assets. Done well, a stable, budgeted Reserve Funding Plan will collect sufficient funds from the owners who enjoyed the use of those assets, so the association is financially prepared for the irregular expenditures scattered through future years when those projects eventually require replacement.

</table>

For this Update No-Site-Visit Reserve Study, we started with a review of your prior Reserve Study, then looked into recent Reserve expenditures, evaluated how expenditures are handled (ongoing maintenance vs Reserves), and researched any well-established association precedents. We updated and adjusted your Reserve Component List on the basis of time elapsed since the last Reserve Study and interviews with association representatives.

# Which Physical Assets are Funded by Reserves?

There is a national-standard three-part test to determine which projects should appear in a Reserve Component List. First, it must be a common area maintenance obligation. Second, both the need and schedule of a component’s project can be reasonably anticipated. Third, the project’s total cost is material to the client, can be reasonably anticipated, and includes all direct and related costs. A project cost is commonly considered *material* if it is more than 0.5% to 1% of the total annual budget. This limits Reserve components to major, predictable expenses. Within this framework, it is inappropriate to include *lifetime* components, unpredictable expenses (such as damage due to natural disasters and/or insurable events), and expenses more appropriately handled from the Operational budget.

</div>

## How do we establish Useful Life and Remaining Useful Life estimates?

1) Visual Inspection (observed wear and age)  
2) Association Reserves database of experience  
3) Client History (install dates & previous life cycle information)  
4) Vendor Evaluation and Recommendation  

## How do we establish Current Repair/Replacement Cost Estimates?

In this order...

1) Actual client cost history, or current proposals  
2) Comparison to Association Reserves database of work done at similar associations  
3) Vendor Recommendations  
4) Reliable National Industry cost estimating guidebooks

# How much Reserves are enough?

Reserve adequacy is not measured in cash terms. Reserve adequacy is found when the *amount* of current Reserve cash is compared to Reserve component deterioration (the *needs of the association*). Having *enough* means the association can execute its projects in a timely manner with existing Reserve funds. Not having *enough* typically creates deferred maintenance or special assessments.

Adequacy is measured in a two-step process:

1) Calculate the *value of deterioration* at the association (called Fully Funded Balance, or FFB).

2) Compare that to the Reserve Fund Balance, and express as a percentage.

Each year, the *value of deterioration* at the association changes. When there is more deterioration (as components approach the time they need to be replaced), there should be more cash to offset that deterioration and prepare for the expenditure. Conversely, the *value of deterioration* shrinks after projects are accomplished. The *value of deterioration* (the FFB) changes each year, and is a moving but predictable target.

There is a high risk of special assessments and deferred maintenance when the Percent Funded is *weak*, below 30%. Approximately 30% of all associations are in this high risk range. While the 100% point is Ideal (indicating Reserve cash is equal to the *value of deterioration*), a Reserve Fund in the 70% - 130% range is considered strong (low risk of special assessment).

Measuring your Reserves by Percent Funded tells how well prepared your association is for upcoming Reserve expenses. New buyers should be very aware of this important disclosure!

# How much should we transfer to Reserves?

According to National Reserve Study Standards, there are four Funding Principles to balance in developing your Reserve Funding Plan. Our first objective is to design a plan that provides you with *sufficient cash* to perform your Reserve projects on time. Second, a *stable rate of ongoing Reserve transfers* is desirable because it keeps these naturally irregular expenses from unsettling the budget.

  <div style="background-color: #F44336; color: white; padding: 5px 10px; border-radius: 5px;">Fiscally Responsible</div>
</div>

**RESERVE FUNDING PRINCIPLES**

Reserve transfers that are *evenly distributed* over current and future owners enable each owner to pay their fair share of the association's Reserve expenses over the years. And finally, we develop a plan that is *fiscally responsible* and safe for Board members to recommend to their association. Remember, it is the Board's *job* to provide for the ongoing care of the common areas. Board members invite liability exposure when Reserve transfers are inadequate to offset ongoing common area deterioration.

## What is our Recommended Funding Goal?

Maintaining the Reserve Fund at a level equal to the value of deterioration is called "**Full Funding**" (100% Funded). As each asset ages and becomes "used up," the Reserve Fund grows proportionally. **This is simple, responsible, and our recommendation.** Evidence shows that associations in the 70 - 130% range enjoy a low risk of special assessments or deferred maintenance.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 10px;">
  <div style="background-color: #F44336; color: white; padding: 5px 10px; border-radius: 5px;">Full Funding</div>

  <div style="background-color: #FFD54F; color: black; padding: 5px 10px; border-radius: 5px;">Baseline Funding</div>
</div>

**FUNDING OBJECTIVES**

Allowing the Reserves to fall close to zero, but not below zero, is called **Baseline Funding**. Doing so allows the Reserve Fund to drop into the 0 - 30% range, where there is a high risk of special assessments & deferred maintenance. Since Baseline Funding still provides for the timely execution of all Reserve projects, and only the "margin of safety" is different, recommended Reserve transfers for Baseline Funding average only 10% to 15% less than Full Funding recommendations. **Threshold Funding** is the title of all other Cash or Percent Funded objectives *between* Baseline Funding and Full Funding.

# Projected Expenses

While this Reserve Study looks forward 30 years, we have no expectation that all these expenses will all take place as anticipated. This Reserve Study needs to be updated annually because we expect the timing of these expenses to shift and the size of these expenses to change. We do feel more certain of the timing and cost of near-term expenses than expenses many years away. The figure below summarizes the projected future expenses at your association as defined by your Reserve Component List. A summary of these expenses are shown in the 30-yr Summary Table, while details of the projects that make up these expenses are shown in the Cash Flow Detail Table.

# Reserve Fund Status

The starting point for our financial analysis is your Reserve Fund balance, projected to be $35,075 as-of the start of your Fiscal Year on 1/1/2025. As of that date, your Fully Funded Balance is computed to be $71,015 (see Fully Funded Balance Table). This figure represents the deteriorated value of your common area components.

# Recommended Funding Plan

Based on your current Percent Funded and your near-term and long-term Reserve needs, we are recommending budgeted transfers of $950 per month this Fiscal Year. The overall 30-yr plan, in perspective, is shown below. This same information is shown numerically in both the 30-yr Summary Table and the Cash Flow Detail Table.

# Table Descriptions

**Executive Summary** is a summary of your Reserve Components

**Reserve Component List Detail** discloses key Component information, providing the foundation upon which the financial analysis is performed.

**Fully Funded Balance** shows the calculation of the Fully Funded Balance for each of your components, and their specific proportion related to the property total. For each component, the Fully Funded Balance is the fraction of life used up multiplied by its estimated Current Replacement Cost.

**Component Significance** shows the relative significance of each component to Reserve funding needs of the property, helping you see which components have more (or less) influence than others on your total Reserve funding requirements. The deterioration cost/yr of each component is calculated by dividing the estimated Current Replacement Cost by its Useful Life, then that component’s percentage of the total is displayed.

**30-Yr Reserve Plan Summary** provides a one-page 30-year summary of the cash flowing into and out of the Reserve Fund, with a display of the Fully Funded Balance, Percent Funded, and special assessment risk at the beginning of each year.

**30-Year Income/Expense Detail** shows the detailed income and expenses for each of the next 30 years. This table makes it possible to see which components are projected to require repair or replacement in a particular year, and the size of those individual expenses.

# Accuracy, Limitations, and Disclosures

"The reserve study should be reviewed carefully. It may not include all common and limited common element components that will require major maintenance, repair or replacement in future years, and may not include regular transfers to a reserve account for the cost of such maintenance, repair, or replacement. The failure to include a component in a reserve study, or to provide transfers to a reserve account for a component, may, under some circumstances, require you to pay on demand as a special assessment your share of common expenses for the cost of major maintenance, repair or replacement of a reserve component."

Association Reserves and its employees have no ownership, management, or other business relationships with the client other than this Reserve Study engagement. Christian Colunga, company President, is a credentialed Reserve Specialist (#208). All work done by Association Reserves WA, LLC is performed under his responsible charge and is performed in accordance with National Reserve Study Standards (NRSS). There are no material issues to our knowledge that have not been disclosed to the client that would cause a distortion of the client’s situation. Per NRSS, information provided by official representative(s) of the client, vendors, and suppliers regarding financial details, component physical details and/or quantities, or historical issues/conditions will be deemed reliable, and is not intended to be used for the purpose of any type of audit, quality/forensic analysis, or background checks of historical records. As such, information provided to us has not been audited or independently verified. Estimates for interest and inflation have been included, because including such estimates are more accurate than ignoring them completely. When we are hired to prepare Update reports, the client is considered to have deemed those previously developed component quantities as accurate and reliable, whether established by our firm or other individuals/firms (unless specifically mentioned in our Site Inspection Notes). During inspections our company standard is to establish measurements within 5% accuracy, and our scope includes visual inspection of accessible areas and components and does not include any destructive or other testing. Our work is done only for budget purposes. Uses or expectations outside our expertise and scope of work include, but are not limited to: project audit, quality inspection, and the identification of construction defects, hazardous materials, or dangerous conditions. Identifying hidden issues such as but not limited to, plumbing or electrical problems are also outside our scope of work. Our estimates assume proper original installation & construction, adherence to recommended preventive maintenance, a stable economic environment, and do not consider frequency or severity of natural disasters. Our opinions of component Useful Life, Remaining Useful Life, and current or future cost estimates are not a warranty or guarantee of actual costs or timing. Because the physical and financial status of the property, legislation, the economy, weather, owner expectations, and usage are all in a continual state of change over which we have no control, we do not expect that the events projected in this document will all occur exactly as planned. This Reserve Study is by nature a “one-year” document in need of being updated annually so that more accurate estimates can be incorporated. It is only because a long-term perspective improves the accuracy of near-term planning that this Report projects expenses into the future. We fully expect a number of adjustments will be necessary through the interim years to the cost and timing of expense projections and the funding necessary to prepare for those estimated expenses. In this engagement our compensation is not contingent upon our conclusions, and our liability in any matter involving this Reserve Study is limited to our fee for services rendered.

# Component Details

The primary purpose of the Component Details appendix is to provide the reader with the basis of our funding assumptions resulting from our research and analysis. The information presented here represents a wide range of components that were observed and measured against National Reserve Study Standards to determine if they meet the criteria for reserve funding: 1) The project is the Association’s present obligation. 2) The need and schedule of a project can be reasonably anticipated. 3) The total cost of the project is material, can be estimated and includes all direct & related costs. Not all your components may have been found appropriate for reserve funding. In our judgment, the components meeting the above four criteria are shown with the Useful Life (how often the project is expected to occur), Remaining Useful Life (when the next instance of the expense will be) and representative market cost range termed “Best Cost” and “Worst Cost”. There are many factors that can result in a wide variety of potential costs, and we have attempted to present the cost range in which your actual expense will occur. Where no Useful Life, Remaining Useful Life, or pricing exists, the component was deemed inappropriate for Reserve Funding.
