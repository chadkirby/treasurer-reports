# Notes to the Cash Inflows Table
1. Data Source & Scope: These figures are derived from the detailed General Ledger reports provided by the Management Company. Data for 2020 represents a partial year (June through December). Data for 2025 covers the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2025.

2. Regular Assessments (Dues): The steady increase in HOA Dues (from $44k in 2020 to $72k in 2025) reflects the community's stabilization as more lots were sold and began paying assessments. This is the Association's only reliable source of operating cash.

3. Conveyance Assessments (Restricted Funds): The row labeled "Conveyance Assessments" represents the $500 fee collected upon the sale of a home (GL Account 300150).
    - CC&R Restriction: Per the First Amendment to the CC&Rs, these funds are restricted exclusively for the maintenance and repair of Common Areas.
    - Actual Use: Between 2021 and 2025, the Management Company treated this revenue as a funding source for the Developer. Rather than retaining this cash for HOA repairs, $49,000 was transferred out to Lotus House Development Corp.
    - Reporting Impact: Because the Management Company recorded the payments to the Developer as debits to this income account (contra-revenue) rather than as expenses, standard profit and loss reports may show this line item as near-zero, hiding the volume of cash that actually passed through the account.

4. "Other" Income: This category includes fines, late fees, and minimal bank interest. It is highly variable and should not be relied upon for budgeting core operating expenses. Notably, Legal Fee reimbursements (GL 300400) often appear here, but these simply offset legal expenses incurred to collect delinquent dues.
