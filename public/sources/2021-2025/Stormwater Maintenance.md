# Stormwater Maintenance Obligations

The Association is bound by the Residential Subdivision Agreement to Maintain Stormwater Facilities recorded with Thurston County. Failure to adhere to these requirements can result in the County performing the work and placing a lien on the property for the costs.

## Primary Obligations

- Maintenance Implementation: The Association must implement the specific maintenance program detailed in "Attachment A" of the agreement. This includes maintaining catch basins, pipes, the wet pond, and the infiltration pond.
    - Critical Standard: The infiltration pond must be kept clean of silts and sediments. If infiltration tests show a rate lower than 2 inches per hour, additional construction/remediation is required.

- Inspection Schedule:
    - Monthly: From November through April.
    - Annually: Once in late summer (preferably September).
    - Post-Storm: After any major storm (defined as 1 inch of rain in 24 hours).

- Documentation (The Log Book): The Association must maintain a "Log Book" cataloging inspections, actions taken, who performed them, and any problems encountered. This log book must be available for inspection by Thurston County.

- Annual Reporting: An annual report must be submitted to Thurston County on or before August 31st of each year. This report must include a summary of activities, photocopies of the log book, and an outline of planned activities for the next year.

- Financial Responsibility: The Association assumes all responsibility for the cost of maintenance and repairs. If the County is forced to intervene, the HOA must reimburse the County within 30 days of invoice.

## Cost Estimate for Maintenance

The Maintenance Agreement contains a specific "Cost Estimate for Maintenance" breakdown (in 2011 dollars).

- Agreement Estimate: 116.5 labor hours per year. Total estimated cost: $1,747.50 per year.

## Actual Maintenance Costs

Based on the general ledger reports, the HOA has made numerous payments to Sustainable Groundworks LLC between August 2022 and December 2025. These payments are primarily categorized under Stormwater/Detention Pond maintenance, with earlier payments classified as Landscaping (Non-contract).

The payments, listed chronologically, are as follows:

### 2022
- August 12, 2022: $1,533.00 (Invoice #1135) for Landscaping (Non-contract).
- September 21, 2022: $7,117.50 (Invoice #1140) for Stormwater/Detention Pond maintenance.
- November 3, 2022: $13,254.98 (Invoice #1216) for Stormwater/Detention Pond maintenance.

### 2023
- March 2, 2023: $547.50 (Invoice #1234) for Landscaping (Non-contract).
- July 3, 2023: $5,146.50 (Invoice #1259) for Stormwater/Detention Pond maintenance,.
- September 25, 2023: $5,146.50 (Invoice #1303) for Stormwater/Detention Pond maintenance,.
- October 10, 2023: $5,155.90 (Invoice #1407) for Stormwater/Detention Pond maintenance,.

### 2024
- June 24, 2024: $5,155.90 (Invoice #1363) for Stormwater/Detention Pond maintenance,.

### 2025
- May 13, 2025: $4,519.64 (Invoice #1442) for Stormwater/Detention Pond maintenance,.
- September 17, 2025: $4,519.64 (Invoice #1464) for Stormwater/Detention Pond maintenance,.
- December 8, 2025: $4,519.64 (Invoice #1494) for Stormwater/Detention Pond maintenance,.

Note: One source document labeled "2025-07-31" contained data duplicate to the July 2023 ledger (Invoice #1259), suggesting a labeling error in the source file; that duplicate entry has been excluded from the 2025 list above to avoid double-counting. This was probably a simple clerical error.

Even if we adjust the labor rate from the 2011 estimate (15/hr) to a reasonable market rate (65/hr), the annual cost should be roughly $7,572. The HOA is paying double to triple that amount.
