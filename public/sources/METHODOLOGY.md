# Methodology and Disclaimers

## Data Sources
The financial data presented in this report was derived directly from the detailed General Ledger (GL) reports provided by the Management Company, covering the period from June 2020 through December 2025. Unlike standard "Profit & Loss" statements, which summarize data into broad categories, the GL allows for the analysis of every individual check, deposit, and invoice.

## Methodology: Cash-Flow vs. Accounting Categories
Standard financial reports often obscure where cash actually goes due to accounting conventions. To create the charts in this presentation, NotebookLM performed the heavy lifting of data analysis using a "cash-flow" methodology:

- Reclassifying "Contra-Revenue": The Management Company recorded payments to the Developer (Lotus House) as negative income (debits to GL 300150) rather than expenses. In standard reports, these vanish from the expense column. NotebookLM has reclassified these as Cash Outflows to transparently show that money left the Association’s bank account.

- Vendor Grouping: NotebookLM grouped payments by the entity receiving the money rather than the account code used. For example, payments to Simply Home Realty were found in both "Landscaping" and "Maintenance" accounts. These have been consolidated under VIS Group to show the total cash flow going to the management firm and its affiliates.

- 2020 Data: Please note that 2020 data covers only June through December. Annualized comparisons for that year should be viewed with caution.

## Margins of Error & Confidence
While every effort has been made to ensure precision, this analysis involves the automated aggregation by NotebookLM of thousands of line items from PDF reports.

- Total Cash Flow: High Confidence. The total amounts leaving the bank accounts reconcile with the monthly net changes in the Operating Fund.

- Categorization: Medium Confidence. Due to inconsistent coding by the Management Company (e.g., moving expenses between "Water" and "Stormwater" or "Maintenance" and "Landscaping" over the years), exact line-item totals may have a margin of error of approximately ±5%.

- Missing Data: NotebookLM identified instances of duplicate invoice numbers in the ledgers (specifically May 2024 vs. May 2025) which may require further audit to resolve.

## Conclusion

These figures should be viewed as **directionally accurate rather than forensic absolutes**.

While a specific category might be off due to coding inconsistencies in the raw reports, the macro trends (specifically regarding the escalation of stormwater costs, the total volume of payments to the Developer, and the aggregate cost of management services) are distinct and supported by the record.
